# TACSCAN-AI 🫁🔬  
*A deep learning project for thoracic CT scan classification*

TACSCAN-AI is a student project developed for the **Sistemi Digitali** course at the University of Bologna. The goal is to explore the use of deep learning techniques for classifying **thoracic CT scans** into *normal* and *pathological* categories.

## 🎯 Objective

This project aims to implement a basic convolutional neural network (CNN) to:
- Process 2D slices or small volumes from thoracic CT scans
- Learn discriminative features between normal and pathological images
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics

This work is exploratory and educational in nature — not intended for clinical deployment.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- PyTorch  
- NumPy / Pandas  
- (Planned) SimpleITK or similar for image handling  
- Jupyter Notebooks  

## 📍 Project Status

🧾 Dataset exploration (in progress)  
🔬 Preprocessing pipeline (planned)  
🧠 Model design and training (coming next)  
📊 Evaluation and reporting (to follow)

## 📁 Repository Structure (planned)

```
/data                – contains metadata or references to external image sources
/notebooks           – Jupyter notebooks for experiments and training
/models              – saved model checkpoints and weights
/scripts             – utility scripts for preprocessing, training, evaluation
/docs                – course report, documentation, presentation material
```
